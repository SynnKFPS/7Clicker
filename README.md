## 7Clicker Source (but it's currently buildable

**Current JAR on Releases.**<br>
99.9% of the credits goes to __JohnShiozo__ . That made the source currently buildable and working (100% now)<br>
Also, the original source is (obviously) from **@Ruffian7**, many years ago he did this man.

**Discords: (if you want support)**<br>
