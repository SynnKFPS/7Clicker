# 7Clicker
## It's the 7Clicker source but it's buildable
**NOT 100%!!!!! READ**

When starting the source, the 7Clicker will open normally but you won't be able to use it, that's because I couldn't make GlobalScreen.java and AutoClicker.java work, they're having some error that I couldn't solve.

If you can fix the error, please send me a message in my discord OR send in issues, I will be grateful for that.
